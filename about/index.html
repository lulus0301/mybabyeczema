I am so happy you are here. You are probably here because you are looking for answers to your baby's eczema. I wish I can say I have the solution to the problem. Unfortunately, eczema is not that simple. Our story was a lot of trial and error and what worked best for my Baby J.</p><p>This blog is many years in the making as I contemplated whether to share this much of Baby J's young life to the world. Before having Baby J, my husband and I made the very personal choice to never post any photos or anything about Baby J on social media (we are not on Facebook or Instagram) and even asked our families and friends to do the same. We want to respect Baby J's privacy and leave the decision of how and what his online presence would look like to him. Our story is far as I will go, as the journey is as much his as it is mine.</p><p>I know the challenges of motherhood and the struggles that come with dealing with a child with eczema and I want you to know that you are not alone in this journey. Mamas need support!</p><p>I am here to share my passion for living a healthier, more natural, holistic lifestyle through whole foods with you.</p><h3 id="experience">Experience</h3><p>Before I became a stay at home mama, I was a teacher with over 12 years of experience in education. I have a master's degree in early childhood and special education from NYU and an administrative credential. I taught students in PreK to 8th grade in both general and special education settings from NYC to southern and northern CA, and England, and Belgium. I lived in Europe for a little over 3 years, where I taught elementary school students on American military bases to our U.S. military families deployed overseas. That was an amazing experience.</p><h3 id="family">Family</h3><p>My husband and I have been together for more than a decade. We have traveled and lived in many different parts of the world. We have our one and only Baby J and he is more than enough for us. Plus, we have a sweet one-eyed boston terrier named Syrup. He used to have a Maple by his side. Maple was the best three-legged wheelchaired miniature dachshund. Sadly, she is no longer with us. Our life has been nothing short of an adventure.</p><p>When not being the caretaker of my little clan, I enjoy reading, cycling with Peloton, yoga, tending to our vegetable garden with my boy, and relaxing with a face mask in the evenings with an occasional chocolate treat or two.</p><p>My secret talent is the ability to fold fitted sheets. </p>
